    <h2>About Project Aerial</h2>
    <p>This is a collection of various photography I have taken through the years. I have enjoyed photography for a long time and wanted to put content that would be appealing. Some of the work showed here is also contributed by ELE Photography - my father’s photography group in Maui. The section on Maui is done by him. I encourage you to look him up, I think he does great work - and I’ll admit that I have a while to go before I understand as much about photography as he does.</p>
    <p>For this web site, I wanted to build a site with simple content so that I could focus on learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I wanted the structure of the site to be ready for a shift in content. Project Aerial is a recent venture and I am collaborating on with a range of professionals that are interested in developing a conversation around Preservation + Technology. The content on this page will be replaces by articles showcasing our case studies, and new technologies.</p>

            <h2>Through Iceland</h2>
            <p>During the summer of 2015, I went on a family trip to Iceland. We had the unique chance of taking a guided glacier hike up the tongue of a glacier. This view is taken during that hike.</p>

            <p>This view is taken from a little boat we took out on a glacier bay. The bay is formed by the melting ice - needless to say, the bay has been growing at increasing rates over the past 20 years. </p>

            <p>The type of stones shown here are grey Lava Rocks. They tend to be very smooth and easy to walk on, unlike the darker, newer lava rocks. I don't advise walking on thos barefoot.</p>
